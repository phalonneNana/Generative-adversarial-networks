# Generative-adversarial-networks
 In this project, we create and train a small GAN from scratch on the MNIST dataset. We  display a few generated images as training progresses and inspect them visually. 
 The goal is to generate new images that are similar to the ones in the dataset We  also implement the idea of ’Inception scores’ to evaluate our model. 

 The notebook is well documented and commented. Just follow each step and read the comment after each cell.
